      <p>Hello, my name is Mike Strydom and I hail from South Africa. I am really looking 
        forward to this Web Development Course so that I can develop an important skill set.
      I work as a Grounds Supervisor at the Durban, South Africa Temple. I love being outdoors
    , reading and spending time with my family. I am a horticulturist by trade for the past
  29 years. I am currently at the Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo Temple, assisting
with their temple grounds.</p>
